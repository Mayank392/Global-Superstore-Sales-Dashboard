Quantity Sold: 178.31K items
Average Delivery Days: 4 days
Return Orders: 1079 total

Visual Breakdown:
Sales by Segment: Corporate leads with 51.48%, followed by Consumer and Home Office.
Sales by Market: Asia Pacific dominates (31.98%), followed by USCA and Europe.
Top 10 Customers: Ranked by total profit, with Tamara Chand generating the highest profit of $8.7K.
Product Profitability: Canon imageCLASS tops the profit chart, while Cubify Cube3 3D printer registers the highest loss.
